# face_swap
face swap like deep fakes.

I'm sorry I have put everything in one file. To test, just put n_epochs = 0.

Please see output video. I cannot provide the saved model or the data cause I cannot disclose Siraj's face images.

- Someone please add de-convolution layers.
- It needs more training and a way more diverse dataset. I'll be trying to upgrade it. For now, I've uploaded this for Siraj Raval's coding challange.
